1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git file is created, which contains all the metadata of the repository files. Now all the changes to files in the repository can be tracked.
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a temporary 'holding cell' for files you want to add to a commit. The working directory and repository are storage that is permanent unless purposely deleted.
3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You can compare files in the staging area with those in the working directory and most recent commit to keep track of changes you make.
