When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I might be working on a different computer, or when I might want to let other people make changes to my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If, for example, someone else made changes on files in your remote repository, you might decide you don't want to keep those changes. In that case, you wouldn't want those changes automatically synced with your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is when you make a copy of someone else's repository so that you can make your own changes without affecting the other person's work. A clone is when you copy a repository onto your local device. A branch is a departure from the main commit history that allows you to make changes to files that don't get committed to the main (master) history.
    Fork a repository if you want to make some tweaks to a repository to customize it for your own needs.
    Clone a repository if you want to work on it on your own machine. 
    Make a new branch if you want to try experimental changes in a file that you might not want to commit into the master branch.
