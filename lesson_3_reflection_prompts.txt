When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I might be working on a different computer, or when I might want to let other people make changes to my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If, for example, someone else made changes on files in your remote repository, you might decide you don't want to keep those changes. In that case, you wouldn't want those changes automatically synced with your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is when you make a copy of someone else's repository so that you can make your own changes without affecting the other person's work. A clone is when you copy a repository onto your local device. A branch is a departure from the main commit history that allows you to make changes to files that don't get committed to the main (master) history.
    Fork a repository if you want to make some tweaks to a repository to customize it for your own needs.
    Clone a repository if you want to work on it on your own machine. 
    Make a new branch if you want to try experimental changes in a file that you might not want to commit into the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That way it is easy to see changes that others might have made while you were away from your computer, maybe?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You might collaborate without Git or GitHub if you were collaborating with someone who was working with you in the same room at the same time. You could communicate with the person directly (through speech or looking at each other's screens), which would be easier than sending pull requests, feedback, etc. 
    It would be very hard to keep track of changes without Git or GitHub though, and you wouldn't be able to share your work with people outside your office very easily. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    On one hand, making changes directly in master would have the benefit of making your work go more quickly, because you wouldn't have to be taking the steps of merging branches after changes are made before you can pull/push. On the other hand, it isn't the wisest choice to make all of your changes in master, especially if you are working on a team project. There would be a lot of commits to keep track of. Also, if some changes were made with a particular focus, such as adding a feature, and then you decided later that you didn't want that feature after all, it would be hard to weed out all of those changes if they were all made directly in master, instead of having a dedicated branch for that feature.
